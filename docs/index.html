        <h1>Nano Defender</h1>
        <p>An anti-adblock defuser for Nano Adblocker and uBlock Origin</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Installation instructions</h2>

        <p>Nano Defender can only protect <strong>either</strong> <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore#nano-adblocker-core" target="_blank">Nano Adblocker</a> or uBlock Origin, and will prioritize Nano Adblocker.</p>
        <p><strong>We are looking for maintainers for Firefox and Safari ports.</strong></p>
        <br />

        <p>Step 1. Install <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoDefender#nano-defender" target="_blank">Nano Defender</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>That is it if you are using Nano Adblocker! If you are using uBlock Origin, then you have a few more steps to follow...</strong></p>
        <br />

        <p>Step 2. Enable <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Feasylist-downloads.adblockplus.org%2Fantiadblockfilters.txt&title=Adblock%20Warning%20Removal%20List">Adblock Warning Removal List</a>.</p>
        <p>Step 3. Install <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fjspenguin.com%2FNanoAdblocker%2FAssetsMirror%2FNanoDefender.txt&title=Nano%20Defender%20Integration">Nano Defender Integration</a> filter list.</p>
        <p>Step 4. Go to uBlock Origin dashboard, select "Settings" tab, check "I am an advanced user", click the gears that shows up, <strong>replace</strong> "unset" after "userResourcesLocation" by "https://jspenguin.com/NanoAdblocker/AssetsMirror/NanoResources.txt" (without quotes).</p>
        <p>Note: If you have another User Resources in use, then you would need to either switch to Nano Adblocker or manually merge resources. It takes an eternity to get any resources into uAssets, I have tried.</p>
        <p>Note: If you are using uBlock Origin, then you <strong>must</strong> have a functional Internet connection when you touch anything in the dashboard.</p>
        <p>Step 5. Install <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fjspenguin.com%2FNanoAdblocker%2FAssetsMirror%2FNanoBase.txt&title=Nano%20filters">Nano filters</a>.</p>
        <p>Step 6. Install <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fjspenguin.com%2FNanoAdblocker%2FAssetsMirror%2FNanoWhitelist.txt&title=Nano%20filters%20-%20Whitelist">Nano filters - Whitelist</a>.</p>
        <p>Note: My filter lists are now hosted on my own server after <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3406" target="_blank">criticism from Raymond Hill</a>. Although the old links will still work if you prefer them.</p>

        <h2>Other information</h2>

        <p>Click on the extension icon for announcements, troubleshooting, FAQ, and known issues.</p>
        <p>We are aware that some may want to see those information before installing; we are reworking the way those information is delivered.</p>

        <br />

        <p>The onbeforescriptexecute event polyfill still does not work on Firefox and it looks like it is not getting fixed anytime soon, so some rules in Nano Defender will only work on Chromium but not Firefox. Firefox is the first browser to get that event and is also the first one to lose it, how sad.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem on Firefox right now is Content Security Policy, but thankfully that is getting fixed soon. I recommend you to block all CSP reports until Firefox got the correct implementation of CSP.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, thanks of some extra APIs that Firefox has, some rules only work on Firefox but not Chromium, I guess unless you are willing to jump between the two browsers, you cannot have the best of both worlds.</p>
