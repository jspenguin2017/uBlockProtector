    <h3>Announcements</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>October 18, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            This is a reminder that installing uBlock Protector List is not optional, installation instructions can
            be found on my <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">home page</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>September 19, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            uBlock Protector is <strong>100% free</strong>, and I do <strong>not</strong> accept donation.
            <strong>Now and in the future.</strong> My GitHub ID is <code>jspenguin2017</code>, my GitLab ID is
            <code>xuhaiyang1234</code>, and my domain is <code>jspenguin.com</code>. Be careful to not get scammed
            by someone who is pretending to be a developer of uBlock Protector.
        </p>

        <h4>September 4, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            My classes are starting tomorrow so I will have much less time maintaining this project from now on.
            I still want to prioritize quality over quantity. I will test every solution before adding them to
            this project just like before. Issues will probably take much longer to resolve as a result, but
            I will be there eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need my attention as soon as possible, prepend the title of your issue with <code>URGENT! </code>,
            I will try to respond within 2 days. However, you must have a good reason for marking your issue as urgent.
            One good reason is if uBlock Protector is causing further breakage.
        </p>

        <h4>August 6, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            Since Flash player will be completely removed in 2020, websites that have anti-adblock after requesting
            Flash support are now low priority.
        </p>

        <h4>July 24, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            I am aware that this page is a lot wider than it should on high DPI devices, it is caused by a bug in
            Chromium / Chrome and is fixed in Chromium / Chrome 61.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Is uBlock Protector List installed and enabled in uBlock Origin?
            <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">How do I do that?</a>
        </p>
        <p>Is uBlock Protector (both List and Extension) up to date?</p>
        <p>Are you using another filter list that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Are you using another extension that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Did you change uBlock Origin settings that may cause it to misbehave?</p>
        <p>
            Are you using Anti-Adblock Killer, AdBlock Protector 2, or uBO-Extra? uBlock Protector does similar
            things as they do which can lead to conflicts.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>Common Questions and Problems</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Will there be a configurable white list?</h4>
        <p>
            Not until I have a reliable way to synchronously send configuration data to content scripts. This is a
            limitation of Chromium / Chrome.
        </p>

        <h4>uBlock Protector is causing (further) breakage.</h4>
        <p>
            Report it and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to breakage
            <strong>caused</strong> by uBlock Protector, other breakages may not be fixed this fast.
        </p>

        <h4>A website freezes with uBlock Protector enabled.</h4>
        <p>
            Some websites will intentionally freeze (with an infinite loop for example) once they detect uBlock
            Protector, it could also be caused by a bug in uBlock Protector, either way, report it and I will try
            to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to freezings <strong>caused</strong>
            by uBlock Protector, other freezings may not be fixed this fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use task manager to terminate the tab that froze, go to <code>Menu -&gt; More tools -&gt; Task manager</code>,
            select the tab that froze, then click <code>End process</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>A website is still detecting uBlock Origin.</h4>
        <p>
            uBlock Protector is not magical, a lot of websites need to be fixed on a case by case basis. Report it
            and I will have a look. Depending on the website, it can take some time.
        </p>

        <h4>I loaded this extension in a browser that is not Chromium / Chrome and it works.</h4>
        <p>
            I am aware that this extension runs in more than just Chromium / Chrome, but I am not willing to spend
            time testing and fixing issues specific to other browsers. Therefore, you must test to make sure issues
            you encounter are reproducible on Chromium / Chrome before reporting them.
        </p>
        <p>I will only publish this extension to Web Store.</p>

        <h4>A website is perceptibly slower with uBlock Protector enabled.</h4>
        <p>Report it and I will have a look.</p>
    </div>

            Their Proof of Work Captcha is not bypassable, I will not add a white list as they start the mining

            need the resource locked behind the Captcha.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will be fixing websites that only ask for Proof of Work when it detects uBlock Origin, but I cannot

            After months of intense cat and mouse game, I have decided to give up. This is unfortunate but this is the
            only way to go. I highly recommend you to stop visiting these websites. If that is not an option, you can
            load uBlock Protector Extension in debug mode to activate proprietary solutions. Click
            <a href="https://github.com/jspenguin2017/uBlockProtector/blob/master/Extension%20Compiler/Extension/content/3-content-rules-4-proprietary.js"
               target="_blank">here</a>
            to learn more, make sure to read and understand all the instructions.
        </p>
        <p>The code for loading these proprietary solutions will not uploaded to the Web Store.</p>

    <h3>For Developers</h3>
    <div>
        <p>You need to edit and load the unpacked extension if you want to enable debug mode or to change rules.</p>
        <p>
            Debug switch is in <code>common.js</code>. It may be already on when you pull the repository. Be aware that
            proprietary code loaders located in <code>content/3-content-rules-4-proprietary.js</code> may run when the
            extension is loaded in debug mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Documentation of my custom API is in <code>content/content-core.js</code>, <code>content/content-domlib.js</code>,
            and <code>background/background-core.js</code>. <code>$</code> is not jQuery.
        </p>
        <p>Rules are in <code>content/3-content-rules-*.js</code> and <code>background/background-rules.js</code>.</p>
        <p>
            Some rules that will help with debugging, along with rules that are work in progress, are in
            <code>content/content-debug.js</code> and <code>background/background-debug.js</code>. They will only run in
            debug mode.
