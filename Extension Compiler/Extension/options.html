    <h3>Announcements</h3>
    <div>
        <h4 class="only-chrome">December 10, 2017</h4>
        <p class="only-chrome">
            If you are using uBlock Origin, you need to head over to my
            <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">home page</a>
            to do a few more installation steps. Everything will be automatically updated for Nano Adblocker users.
        </p>

        <h4>September 19, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            Nano Defender is <strong>100% free</strong>, and I do <strong>not</strong> accept donation.
            <strong>Now and in the future.</strong> My GitHub ID is <code>jspenguin2017</code>, my GitLab ID is
            <code>xuhaiyang1234</code>, and my domain is <code>jspenguin.com</code>. Be careful to not get scammed
            by someone who is pretending to be a developer of Nano Defender.
        </p>

        <h4>August 6, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            Since Flash player will be completely removed in 2020, websites that have anti-adblock after requesting
            Flash support are now low priority.
        </p>

        <h4 class="only-chrome">July 24, 2017</h4>
        <p class="only-chrome">
            I am aware that this page is a lot wider than it should on high DPI devices, it is caused by a bug in
            Chromium / Chrome and is fixed in Chromium / Chrome 61.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Is Nano Defender up to date?</p>
        <p>Are you using another extension that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Are you using another filter list that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Did you change any settings that may cause your adblocker to misbehave?</p>
        <p>
            If you are using uBlock Origin, did you properly follow the
            <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">extra installation steps</a>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you using Anti-Adblock Killer, AAK-Cont, or uBO-Extra? Nano Defender does similar things as they do
            which can lead to conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you using more than one adblocker? Nano Defender can only protect one adblocker and will prioritize
            Nano Adblocker.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>Common Questions and Problems</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Will there be a configurable whitelist for Nano Defender?</h4>
        <p class="only-chrome">
            Not until I have a reliable way to synchronously send configuration data to content scripts. This is a
            limitation of Chromium / Chrome.
        </p>
        <p class="only-firefox">
            I will think about it, but probably no since it is quite complex and when you encounter a problem, you
            should report it.
        </p>

        <h4>Can console messages be turned off?</h4>
        <p>
            No, I need to see the console output on your end to quickly find the cause of your issues, that is why
            I ask for a screenshot of the console when you open an issue.
        </p>
        <p>In production mode, all the console messages will begin with <code>[Nano]</code>, so you can easily filter them.</p>

        <h4>Nano Defender is causing (further) breakage.</h4>
        <p class="only-chrome">
            Report it and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to breakage
            <strong>caused</strong> by Nano Defender, other breakages may not be fixed this fast.
        </p>
        <p class="only-firefox">Report it and I will have a look.</p>

        <h4>A website freezes with Nano Defender enabled.</h4>
        <p>
            Some websites will intentionally freeze (with an infinite loop for example) once they detect Nano Defender,
            it could also be caused by a bug in Nano Defender.
        </p>
        <p class="only-chrome">
            Either way, report it and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply
            to freezings <strong>caused</strong> by Nano Defender, other freezings may not be fixed this fast.
        </p>
        <p class="only-firefox">Either way, report it and I will have a look.</p>
        <p class="only-chrome">
            You can use task manager to terminate the tab that froze, go to <code>Menu -&gt; More tools -&gt; Task manager</code>,
            select the tab that froze, then click <code>End process</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>A website is still detecting my adblocker.</h4>
        <p>
            Nano Defender is not magical, a lot of websites need to be fixed on a case by case basis. Report it
            and I will have a look. Depending on the website, it can take some time.
        </p>

        <h4>A website is perceptibly slower with Nano Defender enabled.</h4>
        <p>Report it and I will have a look.</p>

            need the resource locked behind the Captcha.

            I will be fixing websites that only ask for Proof of Work when it detects your adblocker, but I cannot

    <h3>For Developers</h3>
    <div>
        <p>You need to edit and load the unpacked extension if you want to enable debug mode or to change rules.</p>
        <p>
            Debug switch is in <code>common.js</code>. It may be already on when you pull the repository. Be aware that
            proprietary code loaders located in <code>content/3-content-rules-4-proprietary.js</code> may run when the
            extension is loaded in debug mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Documentation of my custom API is in <code>content/content-core.js</code>, <code>content/content-domlib.js</code>,
            and <code>background/background-core.js</code>. <code>$</code> is not jQuery.
        </p>
        <p>Rules are in <code>content/3-content-rules-*.js</code> and <code>background/background-rules.js</code>.</p>
        <p>
            Some rules that will help with debugging, along with rules that are work in progress, are in
            <code>content/content-debug.js</code> and <code>background/background-debug.js</code>. They will only run in
            debug mode.
